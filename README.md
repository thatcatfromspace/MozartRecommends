## MozartRecommends

MozartRecommends is a machine learning model used for song recommendations within [Mozart](https://github.com/thatcatfromspace/mozart-v2). The model uses the [1 million Spotify songs](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitanshjoshi/spotify-1million-tracks) dataset from Kaggle and uses weighted KNN to build the model and recommend songs.

~~This project is awaiting intergration into Mozart.~~ This project has been deprecated since Spotify does not allow training AI/ML models on their data.
